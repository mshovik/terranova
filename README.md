Hello!

Weâ€™re TerraNova, a service that simplifies travel. We look to offer two main services. The first would be a database that holds a variety of information you seek when you travel: dining, sites, entertainment, and more. The latter would be a tool called Where Next?, which would collect some basic information about your preferences for a coming trip and return various convenient and attractive options for you!

There are 2 applicable directories. They are:

1) terranova-web: All of our front end work is hosted here. It is a combination of HTML/CSS/javaScript and uses the React js library.
2) terranova-backend: This is our backend component, using java and mysql for database work.
